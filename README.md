# short urls

This is a short-url service that works with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It uses its redirect function to make the short url magic. The original method would work with [Netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/), it was based on Kent C. Dodds' [repository](https://github.com/kentcdodds/airtable-netlify-short-urls). Check out the **`functions`** branch, if you are interested.

## Netlify

The repo has an continuous deployment with `Netlify`. It also provides custom domain management which I set up my `Cloudflare` DNS record to `Netlify`'s build in DNS service. `Netlify` caches `301` and `302` redirects response in the edge nodes. So they are cached in a CDN level instead of hitting the server for every requests ðŸŽ‰.
